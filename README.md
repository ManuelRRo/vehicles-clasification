# 2 - Zone Detection

trying zone detection with heatmap - NO WORKING

# 3 - Anotate Zone Detection Video

Define ROI Zones with polygon zone from roboflow and then return a video
with the ROI Zones and number of object detected in each zone .

# 4 - Extrac Frame Real Size

using cv2 extract a frame in original size base on exact video's second

# 5 - Streaming Speed Analysis (Development)

Using streamlit show every frame analyzed in real time in a web browser
this roboflow example is for speed Calculation , parameters like 
source video,confidence threshold, IoU threshold, Yolo model and fps 

# 6 - Speed Analysis Cv2

Using cv2 show every frame analyzed in real time in a window
this roboflow example is for speed Calculation , parameters like 
source video,confidence threshold, IoU threshold, Yolo model and fps 
can be modified via source code.

# 7 - Superset queries (Development)

SQL Files to create database,tables and seed data for yolo model
output data.

# 10 - I don't remember

# 11 - Line Zone Counting Normal
